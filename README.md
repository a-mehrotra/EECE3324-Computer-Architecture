# EECE3324-Comp-Arch

Contains code from Lab assignments in Computer Architecture for Summer 2022. 
Coded in Verilog. 

The Final Project is an ARM LEGv8 processor. It's a 5-stage pipelined implementation in Verilog.

Assignment 7 is a 5-stage pipelined MIPS processor. Many of the components used in assignment 7 were created in earlier assignments as the course built up to implemented the pipelined version of the MIPS processor.
